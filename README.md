## Developing

### Built With
 - iostream
 - string
 - cmath

 ## Getting started

To use the Complex class with polar implementation instantiate with the format bellow.
```cpp
Complex c(5, 45)
```
The first parameter is the real number (radius) and the second is the imaginary number (angle in degrees).

To use the Complex class with euclidean implementation instantiate with the format bellow.
```cpp
Complex c(2, 15)
```
The first parameter is the real number (x axis) and the second is the imaginary number (y axis).


### Setting up

To run the example file, use the code bellow:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/LucasLacerdaCL/complex-number.git
cd complex-number/src/build
```

Execute `./run.polar.sh` to use polar implementation or `./run.euclidean.sh` to use polar implementation.
