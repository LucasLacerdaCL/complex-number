## Developing

### Built With
 - iostream
 - string
 - cmath

 ## Getting started

To use the Complex class with polar implementation instantiate with the format bellow.
```cpp
Complex c(5, 45)
```
The first parameter is the real number (radius) and the second is the imaginary number (angle in degrees).

To use the Complex class with euclidean implementation instantiate with the format bellow.
```cpp
Complex c(2, 15)
```
The first parameter is the real number (x axis) and the second is the imaginary number (y axis).


### Setting up

Execute the `run.complex.sh` file to generate the binary files inside `dist` folder.

For OSX:
```shell
sh ./run.sh
```

For Windows:
```shell
./run.sh
```
